                    <p>Profile<br>Born in Harrogate, Yorkshire, England, Anjou suffered a lot at an early age. However, after enrolling in Cambridge University with his amazing talent, he met Menech Cassel, joined the First Order of the Lionheart, and encountered the "Summer of Mourning" incident, which changed his life drastically ever since.
                        He is now the principal of Castle College and one of the last two members of the first generation of the Lionhearts. He has a bright and open personality, is over 130 years old, and lives by the endless fire of vengeance in his heart. He treats his friends gently and generously with a playboy's demeanor, but treats his enemies coldly and ruthlessly. One of the greatest dragon slayers of all time. He fought in World War II, served in the U.S. Navy as a young man, and was involved in the Japanese Yakuza.

                    <p>Ability<br>The Damascus Alchemy Folding Knife has the ability to kill primordial species. I used it to severely wound Dragon King Constantine (not fully awakened), and Chu Zihang used it to kill Dragon King Yemengarde.
                        (The Atkan Long Knife, with the naturally occurring pattern visible in the casting of the blade, an Ottoman-Turkish Empire style Atkan Long Knife, crafted from rare cold-forged patterned steel. After the eighteenth century, this fabulous steel-making technique became extinct. It was later broken and the head of the blade was fashioned into a folding knife for Angers)
                        Origin: The Atkan longsword passed down in the family of Menek Cassel was broken and the head fragment was used to create a blood-red color.</p>

                    <p>Ability<br>Ange's Spirit is called "Time Zero" (a.k.a. Eternity/Time Zero), serial number 84, bloodline originated from the Black King Nidhogg, and its danger level is unknown.
                        This Spirit is known as the Assassin's Spirit, a paradox and bug in the Spirit, and is terrifying in that it can act on hybrids or Dragon Kings of a higher level than the user. It can speed itself up, slowing down time in disguise, while acting on others within the field. The time within Ungai's domain stretches about 50 times, or 3000 seconds a minute by itself. Its power advancement is able to increase the speed of its strikes by a factor of 2. Inuyasha, the head of the Inuyama family of the Snake Gihachi clan, who had defeated the previous Shadow Emperor of the Snake Gihachi clan, Uesugi Koshi, and the Spirit of Speech, Shana, using Toki Zero. Inuyasha, who was once a "closed disciple" of the Inuyasha family, sacrificed his life for him to deflect machine gun bullets, and was only grazed by a bullet on his eyebrow.

                    <p>Childhood<br>Hilbert Ron Anjou was actually an orphan, his surname " Anjou " is of French origin, but he was actually born in Yorkshire, England, in a small city called Harrogate.
                        Not only was he not a member of the aristocracy, but he was also a very poor child and suffered a lot. His foster parents adopted many children and trained them to beg, and Ange was the most exceptional of these children, being of mixed race and showing amazing talent at the age of twelve. He learned Latin and Greek without a teacher and was recognized by the local bishop, who offered him an annuity to study in London so that he could attend Cambridge University. There he encountered the man who would truly change his life: Menech Cassel, eldest son of the Cassel family, founder of the secret party the Lionhearts, and one of the most accomplished dragon slayers of all time.
                        At the time, Menec was twenty-one years old and Ange was sixteen, and after a lonely childhood and teenage years, Ange met for the first time someone who also carried the blood of a dragon. Menec recommended him to join the Secret Party and become one of the first members of the Lionhearts. But even Menek did not expect that he would unearth such an outstanding bloodline, and that this teenager from the small town of Harrogate would end up becoming the leader of the Secret Party and the end of the dragons.
                        To Ange, Menek was like an older brother to him, and everyone in the Lionhearts was his family, because of whom he was finally able to break free from his loneliness. It was the happiest time of his life, he was studying at Cambridge, secretly involved in the Secret Party, his charisma blossomed to the fullest, girls looked up to him, boys were proud to befriend him, he was a stylish young man of both academics and manners. The playboy image he displays is all a base accumulated at that time.

                        Later Experiences<br>
                        The Lionhearts were nothing more than a student club in Cassell's Academy, while at the time it was the youth group of the Secret Party, the finest squad of dragon slayers in the world. The Lionhearts gave Ange not only friendship, but honor and dreams. Everyone thought the Lionhearts were the light of hope for the Secret Party, and there was no doubt that Menek Cassel would be the next leader of the Secret Party. But then came a sudden change. In what became known as "Summer's Mourning," a nighttime dragon attack on Castle Manor, the headquarters of the Secret Party, led to a deadly battle between the Lionhearts and an enemy of the Dragon King's caliber, who infiltrated the manor, and a group of Deadpools, who surrounded them from the outside.
                        "The Summer of Mourning is a top secret of the Secret Society, and after hundreds of years, the Secret Society has not released the results of the investigation to anyone outside of the Council. But all the evidence points to the fact that the dragons did launch a night attack that should have destroyed the party once and for all, as they broke right through to the core. But there was one man who saved the day, the supremely talented Menek Cassel who surprisingly erupted into a power that rivaled that of the Dragon King and died with him. The Cassel family, the greatest dragon slayer family in history, has since declined, and no one will ever inherit its glory. The Lionhearts were also wiped out, with Hilbert Jean Unger and Friedrich von Roon as the survivors.
                        Angers had come into close contact with the Dragon King, and after being injured, fell into a cellar and was in a state of false death. He revived the next morning and witnessed the saddest sight of his life, bodies piled high, humans and dead men embracing each other in the last moments of their lives; they did not so much understand each other as they held and tore each other apart. The only person standing was Menek Cassel, but it was just a corpse, leaning on a broken longsword. Until then Ange had probably never imagined that a war between humans and dragons could be so decisive, so brutal, so bloody. In this war only one side could survive, and even if all that was left of your body that could move were your teeth, you had to crawl over and bite your opponent's throat.

                        Memories.<br>
                        With his hands, Unger dug his friends out of the pile of corpses and burned them to ashes. He buried those ashes and his own past. He was walking alone in the wilderness when the Secret Party found him, like the walking dead, and when he was rescued he said only, "The world turned out to be so cruel," before fainting. Doctors at the time said they could not imagine that such a seriously injured and dying patient had so much activity, digging up so many corpses with his bare hands and then collecting firewood to hold a grand cremation, the doctors said that there must be some kind of amazing spiritual strength to support this young man whose body was riddled with holes. After that, Angers slept for a whole year before waking up again, and doctors almost thought he would never wake up again.
                        But he was not depressed after his awakening, but showed amazing activity. The "Summer of Mourning" saw heavy losses among the elite of the secret party. The young Hilbert Jean Unger suddenly rose to power, stepping right into the upper echelons of the party. In a way, he was a beneficiary of the Summer of Mourning. But this did not bring him any joy. The old Angers, who used to be elegant, active and conceited, has disappeared, leaving behind him a lonely and iron-fisted man of power. The old playboy is just a mask he uses to disguise himself; in his heart there is only a lonely avenger, always carrying a sharp iron blade. He is constantly consolidating his power, cultivating his cronies and controlling the entire Cassel Academy so that he can mobilize his most elite team when it comes time to slay the dragon. This incurred the school board's displeasure with him, but Unger was irreplaceable, a man who had returned from hell, so he no longer feared death.
                        Once lonely and poor, his life was changed by his encounter with Menech Cassel. Overnight he gained honor, dreams, friends, and even family, only to lose it all in one night and be enclosed in the depths of loneliness once again. The Dragons have taken everything from him and he is determined to get revenge. What the doctors call 'some kind of amazing spiritual power is hatred, the dragons taught him the cruelty of the world, and from that moment on he metamorphosed into the most terrifying dragonslayer in the world. The dragons should regret letting that man live.'
                        Although he had succumbed to the second tier more than 100 years ago, the purity of his bloodline was only lower than that of Menek back then, and after 1 century of exercise, his words and spirits could even work on the Dragon King. He is the strongest dragon slayer in the Secret Party, bar none. Genius has regrouped, and the Secret Party is even stronger than it was 100 years ago. (Note: Time Zero may be a high level spirit, because Ange and the Night's Watch judged that Chu Zihang's father, Chu Tianjiao's spirit was Time Zero, and judged that his blood purity was extremely high, and that it should be S-ranked, and that Chu Zihang possessed a high-risk spirit, serial number 89, called "The Flame of the King".)
                        That's why everyone says, "Don't be an enemy of Ange", that kind of man has a coal mine in his heart, and when his anger is ignited, he will never extinguish it until he burns his enemy or himself to death.
                        Now badly wounded by a white-robed man suspected to be Odin or Chu Tianjiao, he lies in a first aid pod, half his life in the hands of the Grim Reaper.</p>
