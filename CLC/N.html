                    <p>The Nibelungen Project, proposed by the Gattuso family, was designed to strengthen the bloodlines and push the limits of the hybrids, as well as to remove suspicious bloodlines from the hybrids, such as those that have exceeded the "critical blood limit". Participating in this program means gaining power and making great sacrifices. Since the Nibelungen Project was proposed by the Gattuso family, Frost Gattuso also advocated for Caesar Gattuso to be one of the candidates for the project. In the end, Luminaire becomes the beneficiary of the program because of the backroom dealings of the principal, Angers, and the vice-headmaster.</p>
