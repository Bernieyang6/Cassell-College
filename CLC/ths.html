            <h1>Temple of the Holy Spirit</h1>
            <p>The Hall of Valhalla was an ancient Byzantine style building that sat in the center of Odin Square, the outside was decorated with granite covered in dark red patterns, the complete World Tree motif was carved on the entire outer wall, at the top stood a rooster, and at the bottom suppressed the ancestor of all dragons, the black dragon Nidhogg. The walls on either side are filled with the heads of heroes who have established themselves in the service of mankind in the Dragon Slaying Wars through the ages.
                The Hall of the Spirits is a sanctuary-like place in the College of Cassel, used for awarding degrees, and is usually only opened once a year.</p>
