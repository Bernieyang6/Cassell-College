                    <p>Profile<br>Norma Lawrence, the supercomputer at Castle's Dragonslayer Academy, has so much access, she breaches the Pentagon every day. The super-powerful computer system at Castle Academy is a supercomputer with a "personality" that was built in 2003 AD. According to its contents, it is made in the image of one of the people who died in a past mission (called EVA) (who had a very close relationship with Uncle KFC and helped Luminefi many times on his behalf). The defense system is electric shock. The location is 200 meters below the library.Both EVA and Norma are character variants of the same intelligence center, with different neuron combinations, but with the same memory and information banks.
                        EVA is the highest operating state of Norma's mainframe. When EVA is activated, the operating power is increased to 800% of its rated power, the network transmission speed is increased by 400 times, the floating-point computing power is increased by 1,200 times, and the graphics simulation power is increased by 540 times.</p>
