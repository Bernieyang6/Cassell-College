            <h1>The Well of Annihilation</h1>
            <p>The lowest level of the "Ice Cellar", the warehouse of the Castle Academy, is a subterranean cavern eroded by tens of millions of years of flowing water, and the place where everything was destroyed. This is the place where the best collections are kept, as well as the most dangerous items that can easily get out of control, such as the Dragon Bone Cross. The space is filled with an extremely powerful alchemical field, created by the Alchemical Matrix, which releases an effect similar to that of the Spirit of the Word - Rule of Law, forcibly suppressing the artifacts!</p>
