                    <p>Profile<br>Von Schneider entered Cassell College as a professor of dragon genealogy and was a mentor to several cadets.
                        Leading the team during the 2001 Greenland Sea of Ice operation, Schneider's student and Nightwatchman's student Eva all died during the dive, and Schneider encountered a draconic species during the dive, which Schneider shot and wounded, while suffering severe frostbite and contamination with dragon blood himself. He can only rely on a ventilator to sustain his life, and returns to the academy, where he no longer leads students and serves as the head of the executive department.
                        When Chu Zihang contacted the academy alone, Schneider was responsible for observing Chu Zihang and eventually recognized the young man and became Chu Zihang's mentor.
                        Schneider overheard Guderian and Manstein discussing whether or not Lumingfei was of the White King's bloodline, and praised Manstein's lie that the White King was a woman. He later used Lumingfei and Chen Moxu as a bargaining chip to protect Chu Zihang.
                        When the Sakoku Asama troops invaded, they demanded that all personnel except Chu Zihang retreat.
                        Does not agree to send janitors to help Chu Zihang during his mission.
                        In April 2011, remotely commanded Caesar's team in the Dragon Abyss program. Reveals the Greenland Sea incident when Manstein arrives and is ready to stop.
                        Forgets Chuuk after Chuuk disappears.
                        In 2012, leads Caesar, Abbas, and Fingal to the Arctic Ocean while all of Team Lancelot is destroyed, buys the YAMAL, which Chu Tzu-hang boarded before he disappeared, and meets up with Captain Rybalko, Chu Tzu-hang's last friend before he disappeared.</p>
