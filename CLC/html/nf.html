                    <p>Profile<br>The old man who assists Anjou in running the Kassel Academy, even older than Ange. He is funny, loves cold jokes, is well versed in Chinese culture (he once described himself as organizing the Flying Tigers with Chennault in China during the war), and usually dresses as a cowboy and is a womanizer. According to his conversation with Ange, his bloodline is even higher than Ange's, second only to the Four Great Monarchs, so his bloodline level must be S-class. Speech Spirit: Precept, restrains speech spirits of the same level and lower than your own, Spirit. Guardian of Cassel Academy, maintains the Word-Spirit-Precept that shrouds the academy, and is the top administrator of the Vigil Discussion Board. From the miraculous alchemy field in the "Ice Cellar", you can confirm the level of his alchemy, and his bloodline can even suppress Unger. The rope used to bind him in "Odin's Abyss" is so strong that "even the next generation is hard to break free", which is a good indicator that his bloodline is equal to that of the next generation.</p>
