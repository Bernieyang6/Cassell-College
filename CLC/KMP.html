                    <p>In the same year that Lumingfei joined the school, the Cassel Academy dispatched the commissioners led by Mance Rundstedt, Wine De Aki, Ye Sheng and Selma to carry out the "Kui Men Program". Due to the difficulties encountered, the academy called for a state of emergency and summoned all students with A-rank bloodline or above to try to decipher the Dragon Script of the Bronze City in order to rescue the trapped commissioners. In the end, "S" class cadet Lu Mingfei succeeded in deciphering it, but due to the ever-changing structure of the Bronze City, Sakutoku Aki and Ye Sheng were unable to escape in the end. In the end, the whole team was killed.</p>
