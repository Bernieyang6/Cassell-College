                    <p>In the late fall of 2001, Cassel Academy detected the heartbeat of a dragon embryo in the Greenland Sea, and on the "SS" mission "Project Greenland", six of the students of the head of the executive department, Von Schneider, entered the Nibelungen-Avalon Island and found a door during a dive. The embryos suddenly hatched, and Schneider was attacked by a high-ranking dragon during the dive, causing the lower half of his face to completely shrivel up, and the students were buried in the sea of ice, resulting in the "Shadow of Greenland Incident".</p>
