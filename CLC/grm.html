                    <p>Profile<br>Chairman of the Kassel College Wind Discipline Committee and mentor to Moxie Chen.
                        As a part-time faculty member managing the finances of the college, Manstein was somewhat stingy. But when it comes to matters concerning students, Manstein never puts them first. Chairman of the Kassel College Discipline Committee, he was part-time in charge of the college's finances. Took over as mentor to Moxie Chen after Mance Lundstedt's sacrifice.
                        Was the lead mentor in the Bronze Program in 2010, contributing to the killing of Norton, the King of Bronze and Fire.
                        Took sides with students Chu Zihang, Lu Mingfei, and Chen Moxil during the July 2010 SS-class mission with Von Schneider and Guderian.
                        In 2011, the Gattuso family opposed Caesar Gattuso's travel to Japan to take part in the operation. Manstein was instructed by Pompey Gattuso (who was threatened by Frost Gattuso) to come on behalf of the Gattuso family to terminate the actions of Executive Minister von Schneider. But the reason Pompey has Manstein do it is so that Manstein can learn from Schneider the truth about the "Greenland Ice Sea Incident" and oppose the Gattuso family's orders.</p>
