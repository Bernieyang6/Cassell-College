                    <p>After hearing the heartbeat of an ancient dragon embryo deep in a trench, Cassel Academy arranges for Lumina, Caesar and Chu Zihang to form an "ace team" to go to Tokyo on a special mission to destroy the dragon embryo in the Sea of Japan. However, due to the defection of the Japanese branch at a critical moment, the trio is temporarily stranded in Takatenkara of the Cowboy Shop.
                        Genji-no-chan works with Castle to reconcile with Genji-san, and the White King awakens at that moment, leaving Tokyo in a crisis of destruction. The Vice-Principal Vigilante leads the Cassel Academy's equipment department to parachute into Tokyo and intervene in the crisis.
                        After Luminefi kills the White King in Tokyo, he becomes the newly promoted president of Cassel Academy's student council and accepts the Nibelungen program. Later, Cassel Academy learns about the battle between Luminefi and Odin, and characterizes Luminefi, who was fully dragonized during the battle, as a high-risk hybrid, and goes on an all-out hunt for Luminefi.</p>
